#### Execute GPT Queries Directly from the Command Line
The output will pretty print the ChatGPT Markdown answer to console.


cmdgpt offers two modes for querying:

1. **Single Question Mode**: Directly ask a question in the command line like so:

   ```
   cmdgpt "What is the meaning of life?"
   ```

2. **Interactive Session Mode**: Enter a continuous query session by simply typing `cmdgpt`. Within this mode, you can ask multiple questions:

   ```
   cmdgpt
   > What is the meaning of life?
   ...
   ```
